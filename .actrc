# Use medium-sized Ubuntu image (good balance of size vs compatibility)

# Reuse containers for faster subsequent runs
--reuse

# Avoid bind mounts by default: act runs as root and checkout rewrites files,
# which would leave root-owned files in the host workspace.
# Use scripts/local-ci.sh or scripts/container-ci.sh for workflow-aware policies.
# --bind

# Default artifact server path
--artifact-server-path /home/roomtv/works/alopex-db/alopex-core-worktrees/alopex-py-v0.1/.act-artifacts
